### Quick start

  
To run the Python code, complete the following:
```bash
# Install anaconda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml 

# Activate environment
source activate titanic

# Run script
cd bin/
python main.py
```

### Repo structure

 - `bin/main.py`: Code entry point
 - `data/input/titanic.csv`: Primary data source
 - `data/output/mapper.pkl`: Data transformation pipeline
 - `data/output/large_model.h5py`: Serialized Keras model

### Python Environment
Python code in this repo utilizes packages that are not part of the common library. To make sure you have all of the 
appropriate packages, please install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), and install the environment 
described in environment.yml (Instructions [here](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html), under *Use
